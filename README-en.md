<H2>The Essentials in a Nutshell:</H2><br/>
CyberTelly is free software for watching TV on Windows, MacOS or Linux machines. It has two ways of receiving video streams:<br/>
<ol>
<li>TVHeadend: If you have a TVHServer in your local network it can be used as a source for live TV and EPG.</li>
<li>M3u Playlists: They can contain addresses of publicly available IPTV streams on the internet or channel information of a locally installed Sat>IP server / FritzBox Cable.</li>
</ol>
Getting started is very easy:
<ol>
  <li>Download setup file; see link above</li>
  <li>Install program</li>
  <li>Give it a try ...</li>
</ol>
CyberTelly comes with a preinstalled m3u playlist of freely available (mostly German) IPTV channels. It should be possible to watch TV without any further configuration.<br/><br/>
Please note:<br/>
<ul>
<li>IPTV only works with a stable internet bandwidth! Please check bandwidth if you are not sure, e.g. with nperf.com</li>
<li>Users from countries outside Germany may experience geo blocking issues when trying to stream a German channel. May be it will be necessary to download a m3u list from https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv</li>
<li>Pease note, that using using unlicensed streaming sources may cause legal issues. Therefore any and all liability for using downloaded playlists is excluded: The user of this program takes full responsibility.</li>

</ul>
